Having spent just over a year in my first role as a software developer, specifically developing on Microsoft Dynamics CRM, I've realised that it's not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing.

As a result, I've decided to devlop a web app <strong>ProjectX</strong> (I'll go into more details about this at a later date) using Ruby on Rails. The reason for this is threefold.

1. I want to learn new skills such as Ruby, Rails and what it takes to create a web application from scratch, from idea to deployment.

2. I want to develop my existing skills in areas such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.

3. I'm passionate about the idea, which is around art.

Whilst on this journey of discovery, I thought I'd create a blog to share my experience with others.
