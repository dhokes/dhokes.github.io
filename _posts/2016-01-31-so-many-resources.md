There are so many resources available online to those interested in learning programming.  Over the last couple of weeks, I've been going over the courses at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com) to refresh myself in the areas of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Whilst I haven't learnt anything new and groundbreaking, it's nice to go over these areas again.

Some of the other resources I've been recommended:

[freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com)

[Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/)

[RubyKoans](http://www.rubykoans.com)

[Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book)

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
